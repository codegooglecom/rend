#summary Documentation of the factory action helpers.

= Factory Action Helpers =
Rend includes a number of action helpers that work as factories for easily creating common objects based on values in the configuration file.

 * Zend_Acl
 * Zend_Auth
 * Zend_Auth_Adapter
 * Zend_Config
 * Zend_Db_Adapter
 * Zend_Db_Table
 * Zend_Locale
 * Zend_Log
 * Zend_Mail
 * Zend_Mail_Transport
 * Zend_Translate
 * Zend_View

The specific configuration values used by each helper are documented in each helpers documentation page.

== Usage ==
Each action helper implements the direct() method, allowing for easy access in controllers. The following code will get you an instance of the object.
{{{
$object = $this->_helper->nameOfActionHelper();
}}}

Outside of controllers, you can access helpers through the static methods of the HelperBroker with the following code:
{{{
$object = Zend_Controller_Action_HelperBroker::getStaticHelper('nameOfActionHelper')->direct();
}}}
