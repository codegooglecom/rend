#summary Documentation of the factories.

= Factories =
Rend includes a number of factories for easily creating common objects based on values in the configuration file.

 * Zend_Acl
 * Zend_Auth
 * Zend_Auth_Adapter
 * Zend_Db_Adapter
 * Zend_Mail
 * Zend_Mail_Transport
 * Zend_Translate
 * Zend_View

== Setup ==
The Rend factory classes use the configuration file to determine how to load instances of objects. Specifics on expected values can be found in each factories section.

== Usage ==
Each action helper implements the direct() method, allowing for easy access in controllers. The following code will get you an instance of the object.
{{{
$object = $this->_factory->nameOfFactory;
}}}

Outside of controllers, you can access helpers through the front controller with the following code:
{{{
$object = Rend_Controller_Front::getInstance()
                               ->getFactoryLoader()
                               ->nameOfFactory;
}}}

== Zend_Db_Adapter ==
=== Configuration ===
|| *Key* || *Descrption* ||
|| database.adapter || Name of the adapter to use ||
|| database.host || Hostname of the database server ||
|| database.username || Username to use when connecting to the database ||
|| database.password || Password to use when connecting to the database ||
|| database.dbname || Name of database to connect to || 

=== Example ===
{{{
database.adapter = localhost
database.host = localhost
database.username = santa
database.password = claus
database.dbname = thelist
}}}

== Zend_Translate ==
