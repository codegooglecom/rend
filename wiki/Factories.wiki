#summary Documentation of the Rend_Factory subclasses.

= Factories =
Rend includes a number of factories for easily creating common objects based on values in the configuration file.

 * Zend_Acl
 * [Rend_Factory_Auth Zend_Auth]
 * Zend_Auth_Adapter
 * [Rend_Factory_Database Zend_Db_Adapter]
 * Zend_Log
 * Zend_Lucene
 * [Rend_Factory_Mail Zend_Mail]
 * Zend_Mail_Transport
 * Zend_Translate
 * Zend_View

== Setup ==
The Rend factory classes use the configuration file to determine how to load instances of objects. Specifics on expected values can be found in each factories section.

== Usage ==
Each action helper implements the direct() method, allowing for easy access in controllers. The following code will get you an instance of the object.
{{{
$object = $this->_factory->nameOfFactory;
}}}

Outside of controllers, you can access helpers through the front controller with the following code:
{{{
$object = Rend_Controller_Front::getInstance()
                               ->getFactoryLoader()
                               ->nameOfFactory;
}}}
