Rend serves as a base Zend Framework installation, complete with a
bootstrap, config file, unit testing and the default modular MVC folder
layout.

To begin using it, you'll need to make copies of the -dist files.
 * /application/configs/config.ini
 * /public/.htaccess

Make sure you set the REND_MODE in the .htaccess file to 'development' if
you are doing development. This will enable error output to the screen.
